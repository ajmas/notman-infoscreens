Notman InfoScreens
==================

This project is built in the context of the Notman House "Hack the House" intiative.
The goal here is to provide a base for the various information screens around the building. The screens are of various configurations, including display-only, interactive, landscape and portrait. 

What will be displayed is still a work in progress, though how they can work with
IoT devices and other informational data sources, while presenting that information
in a clear and useful way is part of the challenge.
